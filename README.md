# School_District_Analysis
## Overiew of Project
The School district requested to review the date summaries related to the standardized test scores, because they found out that the test score for ninth grade students were incorrect. Following further debate, it was decided that just the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School should be replaced, and remains intact with all other information about this student group. 
For 461 student records, both reading and math scores were replaced with "NaN," which stands for "Not-a-Number." Although this may appear to be a relevant number, this replacement had little impact on data summaries overall.

## Purpose
The project main purpose is to analyze students grades and fundings related to the entire School District. By analyzing the data base it allow us to get insights to provide a better performance visibility for each the school under the district. 
Moreover, to uphold state-testing standards, the analyses were stablished twice in order to mitigate potential academic dishonesty for some students. However, the impact of omitting dishonest data was discussed.

## Results
- District summary.
The annulled test scores affect the updated district summary. The passing rate for reading scores decreased by 0.3%, from 86% to 85.7%. The passing rate for math scores declined from 75% to 74.8%, a difference of only 0.2%. Overall, the passing percentage dropped less than 0.1%
